Split Packages

Splitting packages.

Declaring a split package
*************************

.. code-block:: spec

   %package (-n) name

Declares a new split package called ``$PARENT_NAME-$NAME``. If ``-n`` is provided,

Moving files to a split package
*******************************

.. code-block:: spec

   %files (-n) name

Specifies a files section for a split package. Like ``%package``, ``-n`` will cause
``name`` to be used verbatim. Files are listed based on their location in the parent
package, like so:

.. code-block:: spec

   %files translationfiles
   /usr/share/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo

Files are interpreted as regex.
