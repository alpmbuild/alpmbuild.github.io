                        say goodbye to the old and primitive PKGBUILDs you’re used
                        to, and say hello to the specfiles. packaging is easier than
                        ever with specfiles. with simpler syntax and useful directives,
                        you’ll find using specfiles to be a breeze.

                        alpmbuild is programmed in golang, while makepkg is a shell script.
                        this means your package spends more time actually building
                        and less time parsing the build recipe.

                        we’re all humans, and we all make mistakes. alpmbuild is 
                        created with world-class error messages that tell you exactly
                        what’s wrong with your specfile and help you fix it.

                        ever wished you could target other distros like Debian and
                        Fedora with a PKGBUILD? alpmbuild uses a specfile format
                        compatible with rpmbuild and debbuild, allowing you to target
                        many distros with the same specfile.

                    alpmbuild by default is a very new thing for
                    those used to packaging with PKGBUILDs. this is why we offer
                    directives to make alpmbuild behave more like makepkg, so you
                    can focus on getting used to the format and less having to
                    bother with chasing down files.
